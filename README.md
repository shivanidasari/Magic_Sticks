## Maximum Area Polygon from Stick Segments – Python GUI Project

This project allows users to enter stick segment lengths and calculates the **maximum area** that can be formed by arranging them into a valid polygon. It also visually displays the resulting polygon using a Python GUI.

### Features

* Enter number of segments and their lengths.
* Automatically checks if a valid polygon can be formed.
* Calculates the polygon’s area using the **Shoelace formula**.
* Draws the polygon shape on the screen.
* Allows keyboard navigation using the **Enter** key.
* A **Clear** button lets you reset the inputs and calculate again.
* Error messages shown if the input is invalid or polygon can’t be formed.

### How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Save the code as `polygon_gui.py`.
3. Open terminal or VS Code, then run:

```bash
python polygon_gui.py
```

### Modules Used

* `tkinter` – GUI interface
* `math` – for trigonometry and area
* `winsound` – for beep sounds (works on Windows only)

### Example

Input: segment lengths `7`, `8`, `9`
Output: Triangle with area around `26.83` drawn on the screen.

### Project Structure

* `polygon_gui.py` – Main Python file
* `README.md` – Project description

### Notes

* This is a GUI project, best run on a desktop with Python 3.x.
* Replace or remove `winsound` if you're using Linux or macOS.
